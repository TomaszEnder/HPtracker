# HPtracker
HP tracker for hit points based pen and paper RPGs

It's designed for the Game Master to track enemies hit points during a combat encounter and skip all the quick math that has to be done during it.
Instead the GM can use that focus and spared time to provide better narration and keep the fight entertaining from a storytelling perspective.
The program is very simple and designed to be quick to use. It takes only a few seconds to set up the HP bars for each enemy. There can be up to 10 enemies but it's easy to reduce the number by giving redundant enemy slots "0" HP to signalize that they are not in use.
After the HP setup you select enemies by their assigned number and then enter the amount of damage in hit points they received. The program will show how much HP they have left after the attack and wait for more input.
If an enemy recovers HP you can enter a negative value into the input, this will increase the HP instead of reducing.
When all enemy bars reach 0 or less, the program will let you know. So you don't even need to keep track of that.
